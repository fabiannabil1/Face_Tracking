# Face Detection and Tracking on Raspberry Pi

## Overview
This project utilizes a Raspberry Pi camera module to detect and track faces in real-time using OpenCV, Dlib, and a custom deep learning-based face detector (dnn module). The script captures video frames, detects faces, and tracks them using Dlib's correlation tracker.

## Features
- Uses **Raspberry Pi Camera Module** for real-time video capture.
- **Face detection** using a deep learning model with a confidence threshold.
- **Face tracking** with Dlib's correlation tracker.
- Displays bounding boxes around detected faces.

## Requirements
- Raspberry Pi (tested on Raspberry Pi 3B/4)
- Raspberry Pi Camera Module
- Python 3
- OpenCV
- Dlib
- NumPy

## Installation
1. Update and install dependencies:
   ```sh
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
   sudo apt install python3-pip python3-opencv libatlas-base-dev
   ```
2. Install required Python libraries:
   ```sh
   pip3 install dlib numpy imutils
   ```
3. Clone the repository (if applicable) or copy the script to your Raspberry Pi.

## Usage
Run the script using:
```sh
python3 face_tracking.py
```

## Configuration
- Adjust the **camera resolution** by modifying:
  ```python
  RES_W = 256  # Width
  RES_H = 144  # Height
  ```
- Modify the **face detection threshold** (0-1, higher is stricter):
  ```python
  THRESHOLD = 0.6
  ```
- To exit the program, press **'q'** while the OpenCV window is active.

## How It Works
1. The Raspberry Pi camera captures frames.
2. The first frame is processed using the face detection model.
3. Detected faces are initialized with Dlibâ€™s correlation tracker.
4. For subsequent frames, the correlation tracker updates and tracks the detected faces.
5. Bounding boxes are drawn around detected faces.

## Troubleshooting
- If the script does not detect faces properly, try lowering the `THRESHOLD` value.
- Ensure your Raspberry Pi camera module is properly connected and enabled (`sudo raspi-config`).
- If performance is slow, reduce the resolution (`RES_W` and `RES_H`).

## Future Improvements
- Implement multi-face tracking with unique identifiers.
- Optimize face detection with a more efficient deep learning model.
- Add a logging system to store detected face data.
